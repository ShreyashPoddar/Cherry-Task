It is a a basic mobile quiz application where users can take quizzes on different topics answer multiple-choice questions, and receive their score at the end.
There are three categories of quiz with 5 questions each.
A very basic transition is added to traverse between different activities.
It has a drawer layout which includes home and exit button.
At the end of quiz, final result is declared and correct answers of all the questions are displayed.
It also has a fancy heart button in the home screen, which gives you a cute message when pressed.
The project was made using Android Studio.

These are some of thte screenshots taken from my app:
